**Abstract:**   
We report on a case study in synthetic biology, demonstrating the model-driven
design of a self-powering electrochemical biosensor. An essential result of
the design process is a general template of a biosensor, which can be
instantiated to be adapted to specific pollutants. This template represents a
gene expression network extended by metabolic activity. We illustrate the
model-based analysis of this template using qualitative, stochastic and
continuous Petri nets and related analysis techniques, contributing to a
reliable and robust design.
